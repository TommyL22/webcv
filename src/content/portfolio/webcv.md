## 🧑‍💻 About This Project

This Web CV is built using Astro, a modern static site generator. The structure is simple and easy to maintain:

- **`pages/`**: Main pages (Home, Experience, Projects, etc.)
- **`content/`**: Content collections (e.g., work history, education)
- **`components/`**: Reusable UI components
- **`public/`**: Static assets (images, PDFs, etc.)

The site is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for new sections or features to be added with minimal effort. All content is written in Markdown, making updates straightforward and accessible for non-developers as well.
